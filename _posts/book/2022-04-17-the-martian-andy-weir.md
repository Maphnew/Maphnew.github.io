# THE MARTIAN

<small>저자: Andy Weir</small>

# CHAPTER 01

## LOG ENTRY: SOL 6

- For the record: 공식적으로

- national mouring: 국장(국가 장례)

> For the record... I didn't die on Sol 6. Certainly the rest of the crew thought I did, and I can't blame them. Maybe there'll be a day of national mouring for me, and my Wikipedia page will say, "Mark Watney is the only human being to have died on Mars."

- per se: 그 자체가, 본질적으로

> Ares 3. Well, that was my mission. Okay, not mine per se. Commander Lewis was in charge. I was just one of her crew.

- presume: 추정하다

> I presume they got back to Earth all right. Guys, if you're reading this: It wasn't your fault. You did what you had to do. In your position I would have done the same thing. I don't blame you, and I'm glad you survived.

- layman: 비전문가

- orbit: 궤도

> I guess I should explain how Mars missions work, for any layman who may be reading this. We got to Earth orbit the normal way, through an ordinary ship to Hermes. All the Ares mission use Hermes to get to and from Mars. It's really big and cost a lot so NASA built only one.

- reactant: 반응 물질, 반응물

- nuclear reactor: 원자로

- constantly: 끊임없이, 거듭

> The thing is, it doesn't take mush reactant mass, so a little argon (and a nuclear reactor to power things) let us accelerate constantly the whole way there.

- regale somebody with something: (이야기, 농담 등으로) ...를 즐겁게 해 주다

- relive: 상기하다

- suffice: 충분하다

- strangle: 목을 조르다, 목 졸라 죽이다

> I could regale you with tales of how we had great fun on the trip, but I won't. I don't feel like reliving it right now. Suffice it to say we got to Mars 124 days later without strangling each other.

- thruster: (특히 항공기의) 반동 추진 엔진

- sole: 유일한

> The MDV(Mars descent vehicle) is basically a big can with some light thrusters and parachutes attached. Its sole purpose is to get six humans from Mars orbit to the surface without killing any of them.

- in advance: 미리, 전부터

> And now we come to the real trick of Mars exploration: having all of out shit there in advance.

- deposite: (특정한 곳에) 두다[놓다]

> A total of fourteen unmanned missions deposited everything we would need for surface operations.

- vessel: (대형) 선박[배], 그릇[용기/통]

> They tried their best to land all the supply vessels in the same general area, and did a reasonably good job.

- breach: (합의나 약속을) 위반하다[어기다] (=break), (방어벽 등에) 구멍을 뚫다, 구멍

> Naturally, they didn't send us to Mars until they'd confirmed that all the supplies had made it to the surface and their containers weren't breached.

- en[on] route: (어디로 가는) 도중에

> Start to finish, including supply missions, a Mars mission takes about three years. In fact, there were Ares 3 supplies en route to Mars while the Ares 2 crew were on their way home.

- turn out: 모습을 드러내다, ~인 것으로 밝혀지다, (결과가 특정 방식으로) 되다[되어 가다]

> The MAV is pretty cool. Turns out, through a neat set of chemical reactions with the Martian atmosphere, for every kilogram of hydrogen you bring to Mars, you can make thirteen kilograms of fuel.

- gust: 세찬 바람, 돌풍

- whack: 강타, 후려치기

- huddle: 옹기종기 모이다

- the Hab: 막사, habitat, habitation: 서식지, 거주지

> The mission is designed to handle sandstorm gusts up to 150 kph. So Houston got understandably nervous when we got whacked with 175 kph winds. We all got in our flight space suits and huddled in the middle of the Hab, just in case it lost pressure. But the Hab wasn't the problem.

- delicate: 연약한, 다치기 쉬운(=fragile)

- put up something: (싸움, 시합에서 어떤 기량,결의 등을) 보이다

- extent: (크기, 중요성, 심각성 등의) 정도[규모], (어떤 지역의) 크기[규모]

- sandblast: (분사기로) 모래를 분사하여 씻다[갈다/장식하다]

- sustained: 지속된, 한결같은, 일관된

- abort: 유산시키다, 중단시키다

> The MAV is a spaceship. It has a lot of delicate parts. It can put up with storms to a certain extent, but it can't just get sandblasted forever. After an hour and a half of sustained wind, NASA gave the order to abort.

- punishment: 벌, 처벌, 형벌, 심한 대접[취급]

- strand: 오도 가도 못하게 하다, 발을 묶다, 꼼짝 못하게 하다

> Nobody wanted to stop a monthlong mission after only six days, but if the MAV took any more punishment, we'd all have gotten stranded down there.

- relay: 전달하다

- torn: tear 과거분사, tear: 찢어진 곳, 구멍

- torrent: 급류, 빗발침(=deluge)

> Our main communications dish, which relayed signals from the Hab to Hermes, acted like a parachute, getting torn from its foundation and carried with the torrent.

- tore: tear의 과거, tear: 찢어진 곳, 구멍

- rip: 찢다[찢어지다]

- vaguely: 모호[애매]하게, 희미[흐릿]하게

> It tore through my suit like a bullet through butter, and I felt the worst pain of my life as it ripped open my side. I vaguely remember having the wind knocked out of me(pulled out of me, really) and my ears popping painfully as the pressure of my suit escaped.

- obnoxious: 아주 불쾌한, 몹시 기분 나쁜(=offensive)

- rouse: 깨우다

- profound: (영향, 느낌, 경험 등이) 엄청난[깊은]

> I awoke to the oxygen alarm in my suit. A steady, obnoxious beeping that eventually roused me from a deep and profound desire to just fucking die.

- abate: (강도가) 약해지다, 약화시키다[줄이다]

- buried: 파묻힌, bury: 묻다[매장하다]

- groggily: 비틀거리면서, 그로기 상태가 되어

> The storm had abated; I was facedown, alomost totally buried in sand. As I groggily came to, I wondered why I wasn't more dead.

- pelvis: 골반

> The antenna had enough force to punch through the suit and my side, but it had been stopped by my pelvis.

- steep: 가파른, 비탈진, 급격한(=sharp)

- somehow: 어떻게든, 왜 그런지, 왠지

- oblique: 완곡한, 비스듬한, 사각

- torque: 회전력, 토크

> I had been knocked back quite a ways and rolled down a steep hill. Somehow I landed facedown, which forced the antenna to a strongly oblique angle that put a lot of torque on the hole in the suit. It made a weak seal.

- copious: 엄청난(양의), 방대한(=abundant)

- trickle: (액체가 가늘게)흐르다

- evaporate: (액체가) 증발하다[시키다]

- gunky: 끈적거리는, 찐득거리는

- residue: 잔여[잔류]물

> Then, the copious blood from my wound trickled down toward the hole. As the blood reached the site of the breach, the water in it quickly evaporated from the airflow and low pressure, leaving a gunky residue behind.

- counteract: (무엇의 악영향에) 대응하다(=counter)

> Eventually, it sealed the gaps around the hole and reduced the leak to something the suit could counteract.

- admirably: 감탄할 만하게, 훌륭하게, admire: 존경하다, 칭찬하다

> The suit did its job admirably.

- flooded: 물에 잠긴, 침수된, flood: 홍수

> Sensing the drop in pressure, it constantly flooded itself with air from my nitrogen tank to equalize.

- absorber: 흡수 (장치); 흡수하는 사람; [물리]흡수체, 흡수재

- expend: 확대되다, 확장되다

- limiting factor: 제한 인자(생물의 생장, 활동 등을 제한하는)

> After a while, the CO₂ (Carbon dioxide) absorbers in the suit were expended. That's really the limiting factor to life support.

- absorption: 흡수

> In the Hab, I have the oxygenator, a large piece of equipment that breaks apart CO₂ to give the oxygen back. But the space suits have to be portable, so they use a simple chemical absorption process with expendable filters. I'd been asleep long enough that my filters were useless.

- deliberately: 고의로, 의도[계획]적으로 (=intentionally, on purpose)

> Having no way to seperate out the CO₂, the suit deliberately vented air to the Martian atmosphere, then backfilled with nitrogen.

- excessively: 지나치게, 심히, 매우

- nervous system: 신경계 (-> central nervous system)

> I now risked dying from oxygen toxicity, as the excessively high amount of oxygen threatened to burn up my nervous system, lungs, and eyes.

(page 6)

- sheer: 수직으로

- the sheer volume of business: 많은 업무량

- astounding: 경악스러운, 믿기 어려운(=astonishing)

> The sheer volume of training for a space mission is astounding.

- funnel: 깔때기

- resin: 송진, 합성수지

> It's nothing more than a funnel with a valve at the small end and an unbelievably sticky resin on the wide end.
